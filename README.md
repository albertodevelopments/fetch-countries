## Welcome to Fetch Countries

This is a cute browse with relevant info about countries. It is based in API https://restcountries.eu/, and is one of the challenges from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)

### How to use it

It´s easy and very intuitive. Once you get to the home page, just scroll to find the country you want info from or use the input field to seek it. You can also schrink the number of results by using the selector by regions.

### Additional functionality

There is not much more to say but you can switch the web page theme through a practical button on the header. This was another of the requirements from Frontend Mentor. Also, this application is responsive, so you can easily enjoy it from your mobile.

That´s all! Just play around!
